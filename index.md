## Jiayu Wang (王嘉裕)

Jiayu received his bachelor’s in flight vehicle propulsion engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an in 2014. He  rescived his M.S. degrees in aeronautical Engineering from Moscow Aviation Institute, Moscow and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Currently, he works as a Ph.D. candidate in Trinity College Dublin, the University of Dublin under the support of China Scholarship Council (CSC)-Trinity College Dublin Joint Scholarship (2021).

Jiayu’s research interest includes micro/nano scale mechanical and tribological behavior of human-machine interfaces, haptics metamaterials development, wearable devices with piezoelectret materials, and application of artificial intelligence in human-machine interactions. He is specifically interested in developing advanced human-machine mechanical interfaces that enable high-efficiency, broadband, and reliable human-machine communications, with emphasis on studying the multi-physics interactions in touch interface, modeling non-linearity and tribology of skin, developing next-generation tactile surface and haptic actuator, and application of artificial intelligence (AI).
